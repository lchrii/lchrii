# 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Jericho Sembiring

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, especially using Laravel and PHP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Laravel features, API integration, and frontend magic with Bootstrap & jQuery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool Laravel projects or any backend-focused development.
- 📫 How to reach me: meliala366m12@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to make my own game — ended up falling in love with building web apps instead!
